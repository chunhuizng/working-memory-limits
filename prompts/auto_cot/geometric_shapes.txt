Q: This SVG path element <path d="M 43.79,3.46 L 66.68,10.86 L 56.02,58.65 L 43.79,3.46"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
The given SVG path element starts at the point (43.79, 3.46) and moves to the point (66.68, 10.86). This means it draws a line segment from the first point to the second point.

So the answer is (E).

Q: This SVG path element <path d="M 31.00,29.00 L 34.00,76.00 L 82.00,16.00 L 31.00,29.00"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
The given SVG path element starts at point (31.00, 29.00) and moves to point (34.00, 76.00), then to point (82.00, 16.00), and finally back to the starting point (31.00, 29.00).

This means that the path draws a closed shape with four sides. It is a closed shape with four sides.

So the answer is (H).

Q: This SVG path element <path d="M 73.73,87.22 L 79.29,59.06 L 53.87,38.89 L 73.73,87.22"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
The given SVG path element starts at the point (73.73, 87.22) and moves to the point (79.29, 59.06). This creates a line segment.

Next, it moves to the point (53.87, 38.89), creating another line segment.

Finally, it moves back to the starting point (73.73, 87.22), creating a third line segment.

Therefore, the SVG path element <path d="M 73.73,87.22 L 79.29,59.06 L 53.87,38.89 L 73.73,87.22"/> draws a triangle.

So the answer is (J).
