A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to identify the age of each penguin. Looking at the table, we can see that Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.

Next, we need to determine how many penguins are more than 8 years old. From the given information, we can see that only Vincent is more than 8 years old.

So the answer is (A).
