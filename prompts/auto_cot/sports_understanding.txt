Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Joao Moutinho was out at third."
A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to determine who Joao Moutinho is. If Joao Moutinho is a baseball player, then it is plausible for him to be out at third base. However, if Joao Moutinho is not a baseball player or if the sentence is referring to a different sport or activity, then it would not be plausible.
So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Sergio Busquets got on base."
A: Let's think step by step. The sentence "Sergio Busquets got on base" is not plausible. This sentence seems to be referring to a baseball game, where "getting on base" means a player successfully reaching one of the bases.
