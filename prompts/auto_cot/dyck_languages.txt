Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ [ < [ ] > ] ] <
A: Let's think step by step.
The given input is [ [ < [ ] > ] ] <.

Step 1: We start with the outermost pair of brackets. [ [ < [ ] > ] ] <

Step 2: Inside the outermost brackets, we have another pair of brackets. [ < [ ] > ]

Step 3: Inside the inner brackets, we have a pair of angle brackets. < [ ] >

Step 4: Inside the angle brackets, we have a pair of square brackets. [ ]

Step 5: Now, we need to close all the parentheses in reverse order. So, we start with the square brackets. [ ]

Step 6: Next, we close the angle brackets. < [ ] >

Step 7: Finally, we close the inner brackets. [ < [ ] > ]

Step 8: And lastly, we close the outermost brackets. [ [ < [ ] > ] ]

So the answer is [ [ < [ ] > ] ].

Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: ( { }
A: Let's think step by step.
The given input is "( { }". To close the parentheses properly, we need to add a closing parenthesis for each opening parenthesis.

Step 1: Close the opening parenthesis "(" with a closing parenthesis ")".
Result: ( { } )

Step 2: Close the opening curly brace "{" with a closing curly brace "}".
Result: ( { } )

The sequence is already closed properly, so there is no need to add any more closing parentheses or braces. So the answer is ( { } ).

Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ < < { } > < > > ( )
A: Let's think step by step.
First, let's identify the opening and closing parentheses in the given sequence:

[ < < { } > < > > ( )

We have the following opening parentheses: [ < < { (.

And we have the following closing parentheses: } > > ) ).

Now, let's close the parentheses properly:

[ < < { } > < > > ( ) ]

So the answer is [ < < { } > < > > ( ) ].
