Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Laurie likes GC brand coffee. GC is doing a new promotion for their new coffee flavor where customers can receive a free sample. Customers will receive a free sample if either they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC or they are subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee beans from GC, and she is subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears about the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email list, and she sees that she is.

Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend tells him it's a precious heirloom and he can't part with it. Bill waits until later when his friend is in the bathroom, and slips the bookend into his bag. Finally, Bill leaves his friend's house with the stolen right-side Bartlett bookend in his bag. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?

Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells Suzy: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Then he tells Billy: "Be sure that you do not come in at all tomorrow morning. It is absolutely essential that you not appear at that time."
