Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:

A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion]<[2. size]<[3. age]<[4. shape]<[5. color]<[6. origin]<[7. material]<[8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "rubber terrible ship":
(1) rubber -> material: [7. material]
(2) terrible -> opinion: [1. opinion]
(3) ship -> noun
Based on (1) (2) (3) in Option (A), order: 7, 1, noun:
7 < 1? False
Therefore, because 7 < 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship":
(1) terrible -> opinion: [1. opinion]
(2) rubber -> material: [7. material]
(3) ship -> noun
Based on (1) (2) (3) in Option (B), order: 1, 7, noun:
1 < 7? True
Therefore, because 1 < 7 (True) is correct, (B) has the correct ordering.
So the answer is (B).
