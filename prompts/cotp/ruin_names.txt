Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke

The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".

The title's meaning is changed, so it is a pun. so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", then the word "snapke" means not an actual word; The title's meaning is not changed. It is not a pun. Therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
