Q: I have a blackberry, a clarinet, a nectarine, a plum, a strawberry, a banana, a flute, an orange, and a violin. How many fruits do I have?
A: Let's think step by step.
We first identify the fruits on the list, i.e., removing non-fruits like vegetables, and include the identified quantity in parentheses:
- blackberry (1):fruit
- nectarine (1):fruit
- plum (1):fruit
- strawberry (1):fruit
- banana (1):fruit
- orange (1):fruit
Now, let's add the numbers of fruits in parentheses step by step:
first add blackberry (1): 0+1=1
then add nectarine (1): 1+1=2
then add plum (1): 2+1=3
then add strawberry (1): 3+1=4
then add banana (1): 4+1=5
then add orange (1): 5+1=6
So the answer is 6.

Q: I have an orange, a raspberry, two peaches, a blackberry, an apple, a grape, a nectarine, and three plums. How many fruits do I have?
A: Let's think step by step.
We first identify the fruits on the list, i.e., removing non-fruits like vegetables, and include the identified quantity in parentheses:
- orange (1):fruit
- raspberry (1):fruit
- peaches (2):fruits
- blackberry (1):fruit
- apple (1):fruit
- grape (1):fruit
- nectarine (1):fruit
- plums (3):fruits
Now, let's add the numbers of fruits in parentheses step by step:
first add orange (1): 0+1=1
then add raspberry (1): 1+1=2
then add peaches (2): 2+2=4
then add blackberry (1): 4+1=5
then add apple (1): 5+1=6
then add grape (1): 6+1=7
then add nectarine (1): 7+1=8
then add plums (3): 8+3=11
So the answer is 11.

Q: I have a lettuce head, a head of broccoli, an onion, a stalk of celery, two carrots, a garlic, and a yam. How many vegetables do I have?
A: Let's think step by step.
We first identify the vegetables on the list, i.e., removing non-vegetables like fruits, and include the identified quantity in parentheses:
- lettuce (1):vegetable
- broccoli (1):vegetable
- onion (1):vegetable
- celery (1):vegetable
- carrots (2):vegetables
- garlic (1):vegetable
- yam (1):vegetable
Now, let's add the numbers of vegetables in parentheses step by step:
first add lettuce (1): 0+1=1
then add broccoli (1): 1+1=2
then add onion (1): 2+1=3
then add celery (1): 3+1=4
then add carrots (2): 4+2=6
then add garlic (1): 6+1=7
then add yam (1): 7+1=8
So the answer is 8.
