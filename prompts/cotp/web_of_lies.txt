Evaluate a random boolean function expressed as a word problem. The answer is ended with "So the answer is [Yes/No]."
Let's make "tells the truth" as ✅ and "lies" as ❌.
Then, we can express the word problem as a boolean function.

Q: Question: Fidel tells the truth. Jerry says Fidel tells the truth. Vina says Jerry tells the truth. Millicent says Vina lies. Raymond says Millicent lies. Does Raymond tell the truth?
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Fidel tells the truth. So, we know: Fidel ✅
(2) Jerry says Fidel tells the truth. Since we know from (1): "Fidel ✅", if Jerry says "Fidel tells the truth", "Fidel ✅"=="Fidel tells the truth", it is consistent, then "Jerry ✅"
(3) Vina says Jerry tells the truth. Since we know from (2): "Jerry ✅", if Vina says "Jerry tells the truth", "Jerry ✅"=="Jerry tells the truth", it is consistent, then "Vina ✅"
(4) Millicent says Vina lies. Since we know from (3): "Vina ✅", if Millicent says "Vina lies", "Vina ✅"!="Vina lies",
it is not consistent, then "Millicent ❌"
(5) Raymond says Millicent lies. Since we know from (4): "Millicent ❌", if Raymond says "Millicent lies", "Millicent ❌"=="Millicent lies", it is consistent, "then Raymond ✅"
Now, the question asks: Does Raymond tell the truth? We know from (5) "Raymond ✅".
So the answer is Yes.

Q: Question: Kristian lies. Millie says Kristian lies. Maybelle says Millie tells the truth. Fidel says Maybelle lies. Leda says Fidel lies. Does Leda tell the truth?
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Kristian lies. So, we know: "Kristian ❌"
(2) Millie says Kristian lies. Since we know from (1) that "Kristian ❌", if Millie says "Kristian lies", "Kristian ❌"=="Kristian lies", it is consistent, then "Millie ✅"
(3) Maybelle says Millie tells the truth. Since we know from (2) that "Millie ✅", if Maybelle says "Millie tells the truth", "Millie ✅"=="Millie tells the truth", it is consistent, then "Maybelle ✅"
(4) Fidel says Maybelle lies. Since we know from (3) that "Maybelle ✅", if Fidel says "Maybelle lies", "Maybelle ✅"!="Maybelle lies", it is not consistent, then "Fidel ❌"
(5) Leda says Fidel lies. Since we know from (4) that "Fidel ❌", if Leda says "Fidel lies", "Fidel ❌"=="Fidel lies", it is consistent, then "Leda ✅"
Now, the question asks: Does Leda tell the truth? We know from (5) "Leda ✅".
So the answer is Yes.

Q: Question: Kristian tells the truth. Michaela says Kristian lies. Raymond says Michaela tells the truth. Osvaldo says Raymond tells the truth. Jamey says Osvaldo tells the truth. Does Jamey tell the truth?
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Kristian tells the truth. So, we know: "Kristian ✅"
(2) Michaela says Kristian lies. Since we know from (1) that "Kristian ✅", if Michaela says "Kristian lies", "Kristian ✅"!="Kristian lies", it is not consistent, then "Michaela ❌"
(3) Raymond says Michaela tells the truth. Since we know from (2) that "Michaela ❌", if Raymond says "Michaela tells the truth", "Michaela ❌"!="Michaela tells the truth", it is not consistent, then "Raymond ❌"
(4) Osvaldo says Raymond tells the truth. Since we know from (3) that "Raymond ❌", if Osvaldo says "Raymond tells the truth", "Raymond ❌"!="Raymond tells the truth", it is not consistent, then "Osvaldo ❌"
(5) Jamey says Osvaldo tells the truth. Since we know from (4) that "Osvaldo ❌", if Jamey says "Osvaldo tells the truth", "Osvaldo ❌"!="Osvaldo tells the truth", it is not consistent, then "Jamey ❌"
Now, the question asks: Does Jamey tell the truth? We know from (5) "Jamey ❌".
So the answer is No.
