Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
Then, let's follow the order of operations to evaluate the expression: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5))
1. For the first set of parentheses, evaluate inside:
 - Multiply `9 * -4` to get `-36`
 - The rest of the numbers just follow since `-5 - 0` is `-5` and `-36 - 5` is `-41`
So the first part simplifies to: `-41`
2. For the second set of parentheses, evaluate inside:
 - The sum `4 + -7` is `-3`
 - The multiplication `0 * -5` is `0`, but it does not affect the sum since adding zero does not change the value
So the second part simplifies to: `-3`
3. For both parentheses, multiply the results:
 - `-41 * -3` gives `123`
Therefore, the final result of the expression `((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5))` is `123`.
So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
Then, let's follow the order of operations to evaluate the expression, which dictates that we perform multiplication before addition and subtraction: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))
1. For the first set of parentheses, evaluate inside:
 - Multiply `-9 * 7` to get `-63`
 - Then multiply `-63 * 7` to get `-441`
 - Then multiply `-441 * -9` to get `3969`
So the first part simplifies to: `3969`
2. For the second set of parentheses, evaluate inside:
 - Multiply `4 * -9` to get `-36`
 - Then add `-36` to `-8` to get `-44`
 - The subtraction of a negative number `- -4` is the same as an addition of `4`, so `-44 + 4` equals `-40`
So the second part simplifies to: `-40`
3. For both parentheses, add the results:
 - `3969 + (-40)` which simplifies to `3969 - 40` equals `3929`
Therefore, the final result of the expression `((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))` is `3929`.
So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
Then, let's follow the order of operations to evaluate the expression: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))
1. For the first set of parentheses, solve the multiplication inside:
 - Multiply `5 * 8` to get `40`
 - Then multiply `40 * -4` to get `-160`
Now the expression inside the first set of parentheses is: `-3 + (-160)`, which simplifies to `-3 - 160`.
2. For the first set of parentheses, solve the expression inside:
 - `-3 - 160` equals `-163`
So the first part simplifies to: `-163`
3. For the second set of parentheses, solve the multiplication inside:
 - Multiply `8 * -7` to get `-56`
Now the expression inside the second set of parentheses is: `9 - (-56) + -9`, which simplifies to `9 + 56 - 9` since subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive.
4. For the second set of parentheses, solve the expression inside:
 - `9 + 56` equals `65`
 - `65 - 9` equals `56`
So the second part simplifies to: `56`
5. Subtract the result of the second part from the first part:
 - `-163 - 56` equals `-219`
Therefore, the final result of the expression `((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))` is `-219`.
So the answer is -219.
